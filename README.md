# wordWiz
Wordcount test program in C# for SimCorp. This program runs in Visual Studio in the following way (See screenshots of each step in the documentation PDF: WordWiz_documentation): 
  1) Enter the file location (an exception is thrown, if the file is not found), 
  2) The program prints the result, 
  3) Answer if you require a small additional analysis of the text, 
  4) The program returns the total number of words in the text, the max and min occurences and the length of the longest and shortest word.
